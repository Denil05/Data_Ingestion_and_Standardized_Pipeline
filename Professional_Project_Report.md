KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
✓ End-to-End Pipeline: Automated ingestion, validation, and standardization
✓ Multi-Source Support: Handles CSV, Excel, and SQL/database inputs
✓ Configurable Validation: Schema mapping and rule-based data checks
✓ Comprehensive Logging: Full traceability and error reporting
✓ Extensible Design: Easy to add new sources or validation logic
✓ Professional Documentation: Detailed README and project report

================================================================================

1. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

PRIMARY GOALS:
1. Automate ingestion from multiple data sources (CSV, Excel, SQL)
2. Standardize disparate data into a unified schema
3. Validate data quality with configurable rules
4. Log all processing steps and errors for auditability
5. Enable easy extension for new data formats and validation requirements

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Support for various data formats and sources
- Flexible column mapping and schema enforcement
- Row-level validation (type, required fields, regex)
- Modular, configuration-driven architecture
- Comprehensive logging and reporting

================================================================================

2. METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH

DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE:
Raw Data → Ingestion → Standardization → Validation → Output → Logging/Reporting

FRAMEWORK:
1. Data Ingestion
   - Modular ingestors for CSV, Excel, and SQL/database sources
   - Configurable via YAML file
2. Standardization
   - Column mapping and schema enforcement
   - Handles missing columns and reorders as per standard schema
3. Validation
   - Rule-based checks (type, required, regex)
   - Invalid rows logged separately
4. Output
   - Valid data saved to processed directory
   - Invalid data and summary reports saved to logs
5. Logging
   - All steps, warnings, and errors logged for traceability

================================================================================

    └── utils/             # Logger setup

CORE MODULES:

- **CSVIngestor (csv_ingestor.py):** Reads and loads CSV files
- **ExcelIngestor (excel_ingestor.py):** Reads and loads Excel files
- **SQLIngestor (sql_ingestor.py):** Connects to SQL databases and loads tables
- **DatabaseIngestor (database_ingestor.py):** Generic database ingestion via SQLAlchemy
- **Standardizer (standardizer.py):** Applies column mapping, schema enforcement, and validation
- **Logger (logger.py):** Configures logging to file

CONFIGURATION (config/config.yaml):
- Defines all data sources, column mappings, validation rules, and standard schema
- Example:
```yaml
csv_sources:
  - path: "data/raw/customers.csv"
    column_mapping:
      customer_id: id
      customer_name: name
      customer_email: email
      campaign_name: campaign
      signup_date: date
    validation:
      id:
        required: true
        type: int
      email:
        required: true
        type: str
        pattern: "^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$"
standard_schema:
  - id
  - name
  - email
  - campaign
  - date
```
